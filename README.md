# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

This is a C implementation of the game Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, inspired of course by the TV show _The Big Bang Theory_.

I made this when I was 16 years old and just learning programming. There are many things I'd change about it today, but that would spoil the fun.

## How to run

`gcc rpsls.c -o rpsls`

This was originally built using MinGW `gcc` on Windows. It may or may not work on other compilers/platforms.
